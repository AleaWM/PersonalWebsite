I’ve been insisting on making all data, findings, code, and bonus content publicly available on GitHub. A website with key findings and tables can be found here!\nFiscal Futures Project\nMy little legacy is this GitHub Site and Repository! I joined Fiscal Futures Project in 2021 and transformed the inherited Stata code into R code, while finding errors in past methodology and updating the methodology for the project. Was I asked to do this? No, but I have no chill. What began as personal documentation to track coding logic and my deep dives into the data slowly warped into an RPubs site and then became a full-blown GitHub website."
